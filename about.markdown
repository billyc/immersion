I moved to Berlin a few years ago and I passed the B2 "intermediate" German exam, but I never really spoke German much, because I mostly stayed inside my USA expat bubble. I am trying to fix it now!

## What is Immersion and Refold?

Language immersion is the idea that you can pick up a new language the same way children pick up their mother tongue: by immersing yourself in the language, specifically in what's called "comprehensible input."

One starts with content aimed and young learners, and then you focus on consuming media that interests you, so that it never really feels like work.

The whole thing is explained pretty fully at the [Refold](https://refold.la) website better than I can.
