    <p>The MP3 player is really proving to be super-useful, as I listen to things over and over again to make sure that I can parse (almost) every sentence that I hear. I think having video off and having my phone away both let me concentrate on the language in a very focused manner. Obviously I watch the episodes a couple times first before I switch to the MP3 audio-only repetition. The show has lots of visual narration so it wouldnâ€™t work any other way. But yeah, the audio-only seems to be helping.</p>

<p>But is my listening comprehension for new material actually improving? Itâ€™s hard to tell.</p>

<h2 id="neon-genesis-evangelion">Neon Genesis: Evangelion</h2>

<p>There are still entire sentences that get lost on first listen. Some episodes are easier than others; in fact some scenes I can follow completely. For others I need to flip the subtitles on and try to decipher what I heard. The subtitles for this show donâ€™t match the audio perfectly, which leaves me guessing, too.</p>

<p>This show is more complex with lots of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo which Iâ€™m trying to take in and kinda ignore. But ultimately it is a dubbed childrenâ€™s show, so at some point I need to be able to follow it. Not gonna lie that itâ€™s a struggle; itâ€™s definitely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i+1</code> meaning itâ€™s challenging me.</p>

<p>On the Discord server, some of the learners say that I just need to keep plowing through and that there will be a breakthrough moment when my brain just hears German words, even if I donâ€™t understand them all. I am looking forward to that happening â€“ but we are not there yet.</p>

<p>I am on episode six of twenty-four. Then there are two final movies.</p>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>Keep going.</p>
