Mini check-in after two months of immersion!

- Comprehension is improving. I still have to pay serious attention to follow anything, but when I do I am getting somewhere around 75% of what's said, depending on the content.

- Wearing earbuds makes a massive difference in being able to parse what's being said. Playing anything over laptop speakers or thru the TV itself makes me drop to < 50% understanding. I assume this will get easier as my brain gets more used to German, right? I hope so...

- I listen to the audio of shows I've already watched using my mp3 player while I'm at the gym and bike commuting. This has been really helpful after active immersion / sentence mining, I recommend it!

- I'm not really using Anki at all. I'm just writing down new things that I hear into a notepad. I still call this sentence mining though ðŸ™‚

- This month I finished _Neon Genesis: Evangelion_ (series + movies), and I'm now watching _Star Blazers_ as well as this a very gay drama on ARD called _All You Need_. Honestly it's terrible but it's an antidote to all the schoolgirl anime I've watched thus far. Men with beards! Finally ðŸ˜‚

- I've begun watching some YouTubers to shift toward "native content for natives" instead of dubs; mostly videogame channels including Ulti and Jinja. [Deutsch mit Benjamin](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeutschmitBenjamin/featured) is also oddly compelling!!!

- _Pokemon: Smaragd Edition_ in German is awesome! Download the [mGBA emulator](https://mgba.io/faq.html) and start playing!

## Verdict

OK so I feel like I'm spending a TON of time in immersion between all of these different mixed up activities. Not sure if I can maintain this level through the fall, once classes start in October it'll be harder. But my motivation is sky-high right now.

If this keeps up, I'm hopeful I can bump to stage `Stage 2C` by the end of October! Time will tell. Exciting!
