Ah, adjective endings -- let's be honest, people say this is German at its worst. The rules only "sort-of" make any sense, but here we are and we want to get them mostly right when we speak. It's actually not that complicated once it clicks, but acquiring it fully can be a chore.

Adjective endings depend on the gender of the noun (masculine, feminine, or neuter), so it's pretty hard to get the endings right if you don't know the noun's gender. Immerse until you get a feel for the gender of your nouns! Then come back here.

This guide is for **adjectives that come before nouns** in the sentence. If you're saying something declarative like `Das Haus ist alt` you simply leave the adjective alone.

Ok let's go!

## "Normal" versus "Weird" articles

From immersion you already know that <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">der, die, das</span> feel like the "normal" articles for masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns.

Then there are those <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">weird articles</span> used for the other cases: <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">dem, den, der, des</span> feel kinda weird, right? And for today we will also decide that <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">die for plural</span> is weird, too. (I mean, "die" is for feminine right? Why is it also used for plural? That's _weird!_)

## If the article is normal, use "-e"

- Der klein<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Fuchs
- Ich sehe die dick<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span>, grün<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Gurke
- Das weiß<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Haus ist kein Waisenhaus

In all of those examples, the article is there, it is normal and nothing strange is happening. So add "-e" to your adjective and you are all set

## If the article is weird, use "-en"

If your ears hear a "weird" article -- _den or dem_, or _der_ for a feminine noun, _die_ for a plural -- then use "-en" instead

- Harry schläft in einem dunkl<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Schrank. <br/>(Schrank is masculine, but _in einem Schrank_ is weird!)
- Der klein<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Fuchs schläft in der klein<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Hütte. <br/>(Hütte is feminine but _in der Hütte_ is weird!)
- Sie hat einen rot<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Ball gefunden. (einen Ball: weird!!)
- Die klug<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Studenten kapieren alles. (die for plural! Weird.)
- Bis zum nächst<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Mal! <br/> _See you next time! zum is "zu dem" which is totally weird. So we get "-en"!_

This works whenever the article is present and is... weird.

## Sometimes the article is missing or doesn't have an ending at all

Here's the only tricky one, but it's less common than the other two: sometimes the article trick doesn't work, _because there is no article!_ And the indefinite article <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">ein</span> doesn't mark whether its noun is masculine or neuter; _ein_ is used for both genders and that's imprecise. German doesn't like imprecision.

If the noun stands alone without any article at all, or if the article is `ein` and you can't tell whether the noun is masculine or neuter, then German just... _really_ wants us to mark that noun with an ending somehow, so that we know what case it's in. Consider this the "case of the missing case".

For these, the **final letter from the missing article itself is tacked onto the adjective.** That way, we know for sure if the noun is the subject or the object or whatever. There is a buffer "-e" so that the rhythm of the adjective ending is always a separate (and unstressed) syllable.

Some examples should make this clear, and this will definitely start to "sound right" with immersion, so don't panic:

- Grün<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">er</span> Tee ist gesund. <br/> _It's "der Tee" but we have no article here, so the "r" shifts and we get "grüner Tee."_<br/><br/>
- Ich mag heiß<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Pizza und kalt<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">es</span> Bier. <br/> _It's die Pizza and das Bier, so the "-e" and "-es" get added to the adjectives._ <br/><br/>
- Ich sehe ein groß<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">es</span>, rot<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">es</span> Haus <br/> _I see a big, red house; should be "das Haus" but there is no "das" or "s" anywhere in sight. The "-s" from "das" gets tacked onto the adjectives._ <br/><br/>
- Ich trinke nur kalt<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">en</span> Wein. <br/> _I only drink cold wine; the wine is what I drink, so it would be "den Wein" but there is no "den" ... so yep the "-n" from "den" goes on the adjective_ <br/><br/>
- Ich esse grün<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Tomaten. <br/>_I'm eating green tomatoes; plural would be "di<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">e</span> Tomaten" so we get that "-e" on the adjective._ <br/><br/>

For completeness (thanks @Toast!), one final note on the genitive case: this rule gets one final twist for _masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive._

The concept behind the rule is exactly the same: German wants to lean on adjectives to mark noun cases when there is no article. It's just that sometimes for genitive nouns, those case markings are already present on the noun itself.

Masculine and neuter **nouns** in the genitive case usually have a "-s" appended, e.g. _Die Tür des Auto**s**_ - the door of the car. That "-s" marks the noun as being in the genitive case. There's no need for a "-s" on both the noun and its adjective. Listeners will already know it's in genitive because of that "-s" noun ending. So the adjective gets an "-en" -- just like the "weird" cases above.

Weak masculine nouns (see footnote) -- the masculine nouns which take "-en" in genitive -- don't have a "-s" suffix. For them the adjective takes the "-s" as you would expect. That way the listener can hear that genitive case coming through! Two examples:

- Der Geruch alte**n** Leder**s**<br/>_genitive is already marked on the noun "Leder", so adjective gets "-en"_
- Das Gesuch obige**s** Adressat**en**<br/>_genitive is not marked on the weak noun "Adressat" so adjective gets the genitive "-s"_

And with that, all your adjectives endings are correct.

## Recap

With these three guidelines you can get every adjective ending correct:

1. Adjectives following "normal" articles get `-e`
2. Adjectives after "weird" articles all get `-en`
3. Adjectives bear the burden of the final letter of any missing article (or case), so you can hear/understand what case the noun is in.

## Bonus Round: This works in reverse, too!

This guide is written to help you **produce** adjective endings, but for immersion learners this will help you **understand spoken German, too.**

Now, whenever you hear adjectives with the `-en` ending, you instantly know that the phrase was in something weird! Your ears and brain have now been primed to think "hey, that was probably an object", or maybe it was in a weird prepositional phrase.

As English natives, we are always expecting word order to tell us what's the subject and what's the object. This one weird trick will help you notice when speakers have flipped things around on you.

And hearing those other weird endings like `-es` and `-er` over and over helps us, too: they are secretly telling you the gender of nouns that you might not otherwise know.

Have fun,

#### FOOTNOTE: Weak masculine nouns

Umm, what are "weak masculine nouns" you ask? They are a group of masculine nouns that take special endings. The way to know which nouns are in this group is helpfully simple and also describes how to use them:

   * If a _masculine noun's plural_ is formed by adding the "-en" ending, then it is in this group of "weak" masculine nouns.
   * All of these nouns get a special "-en" ending in **all three non-subject cases:** the accusative, dative, genitive forms of this noun all get an "-en" suffix.
   * Most of these nouns are professions describing men, or nouns derived from adjectives describing men.
      * _der Präsident / die Präsidenten_
      * _der Student / die Studenten_
      * _der Dicke / die Dicken_
