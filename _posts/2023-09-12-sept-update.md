In June 2023 I met my relatives in Izmir, Turkey, and once again noticed that my family there are
not getting any younger and neither am I. I still can't speak or understand Turkish. Several
previous attempts in my life -- during high school, in my 20s, again in my 30s -- always led to
failure. Those previous times I was reading a grammar book and not much else, maybe some flashcards.

What's new this time is that the language immersion approach really worked when I needed to learn
German. So, I'm going to try again. This time is the LAST TIME that I am going to try to learn this language. But I'm hopeful that this
time it will work! The immersion methods I discovered really helped me improve my German, and
everyone tells me that Turkish will be easier to learn now that I already have a different second
language under my belt.

So let's see if this works!

### June

I was in Turkey for almost three weeks, and talked **about Turkish** with my cousin quite a bit, and
some of my previous knowledge did resurface. I can conjugate a simple verb and I remember lots of the
words for different foods. While I was there, my family helped pick out a few children's books for me
to start reading (later) which I brought back to Berlin.

From the Turkish Refold site I also found a link to a spreadsheet with a [list of the 1000 most
common Turkish root words](https://www.turkishtextbook.com/most-common-words/) -- sorted, unhelpfully, alphabetically A-Z. I transcribed every word in
that list along with its one-word English translation into a notebook. The plan was to return to
Berlin and build an Anki deck with those words as my initial base of vocabulary.

My main fear was that my enthusiasm would dissipate upon returning to Berlin -- it's hard to stay
motivated for Turkish when I'm not in Turkey.

### July

**Vocabulary:** I committed to using Anki for 20 new words a day, and I went letter by letter adding
those 1000 words to Anki, creating cards for each. Find the [Refold Recommended Anki Settings](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup) to make sure you are using Anki most efficiently.

I would add all the words from several letters in one sitting, and then spend the next few days having Anki serve those new words up to me, 20 per day.

- For each word I did an image search on the word itself, or on the English translation if those images
  didn't make much sense. I grabbed the most memorable image. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ayran&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) has the most useful image search because you can right-click images in the results page and copy directly to clipboard.

- I also put each word into [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net/translation/turkish-english/ayran) to find a good sample sentence which used the word in
  context. Great resource! [Wiktionary](https://tr.wiktionary.org/wiki/teklif) also has good example sentences.

- For some words I resisted the temptation to put the English translation, but for others it felt like it would be necessary, so I did.

**Grammar:** I also started to re-skim through my _Turkish in Three Months_ grammar book as well as the [elon.io
turkish](https://elon.io/learn-turkish/lessons) grammar website to pick up the meaning and usage of the endless different suffixes. Turkish grammar is not entirely new to me, as I have tried to learn Turkish from grammar books before. So I think,
as immersion learners go, I probably need less focus on grammar than someone starting cold. But even
so, Turkish is _so different from western languages_ that reading up on the grammar is absolutely
essential or you will just be completely lost forever. For me this was often 15-30 minutes of
bedtime reading before I passed out.

**Media:** I also started watching YouTube. In July I stuck to childrens shows and
Turkish-learner channels, some of which are listed below.

- [Peppa Omuz](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=peppa+omuz)
- [It's So Turkish](https://www.youtube.com/@soturkish6970/playlists)
- [Turkishle](https://www.youtube.com/@Turkishle/videos)
- [Turkish Tea Time podcast](https://podcast.app/turkish-tea-time-p63996/?limit=200)
- [Teacher Ali Yilmaz](https://www.youtube.com/@teacheraliyilmaz/videos)
- [Yunus Emre Enstit√ºs√º](https://www.youtube.com/@yeeorgtr/videos)
- ...and many others

At this point, YouTube was incredibly difficult to follow. I turned on CC whenever it was
possible, and often listened to each video a second (or third) time with subtitles off afterwards, to test how
much I could still make out.

This is the hardest stage: I just didn't have the vocab
or grammar yet, and especially wasn't able to keep up with the speed of native speakers. But I still got
something out of it, especially hearing the rhythm and how all those suffix combos sound when they
are spoken all together. _D√∂neceƒüim, bileceƒüim_ sound NOTHING like you think they would.
Natives bend vowel harmony rules and drop syllables all over the place. Madness!

**Time spent:** How did I split my time? I think I spent probably 2/3 of my time on Anki and 1/3 on watching
YouTube. And just a few minutes a day reading about grammar. I'd say about 90-120 minutes a day on average.

### August

By now I had at least 600-700 words (20 words a day x 30 days plus the handful I knew from before)
and sounds were starting to jump out at me as actual words. Because of the way Turkish
works, you can recognize the root of a word but miss the next ten syllables which are attached to it, so
you only kinda have an idea what the sentence was about _"Today...liar....teacher....will able say"_ but
miss pretty much all of the grammar. That's where I am now.

**Vocab:** Still working on that list of 1000 words in Anki, and also started the [Ultimate 5000 Word List](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1091622457) on
Anki. I suspended the first 250 words without even looking, since I surely know them already.
I set new cards to 50 a day (!!) at the beginning, because there is enormous overlap between this
list and my list. But these example sentences are different and it has audio! Too bad the sentences
are often totally unhelpful.

**Media:** I found some bodybuilding channels on YouTube but they talk too fast; but the content is
enjoyable and that's important for immersion. For actually comprehensible input, I'm still using the
channels for learners, especially It's so Turkish and Teacher Ali Yilmaz. In addition I started watching [Pokemon 2nd
season](http://turkcepokemon.com/sezon/2sezon.html) (I already watched 1st season in German), and with matching subtitles on I can sometimes
follow a little bit of it. It is _hard work_ because those damn kids talk so freakin' fast. I'd say
one sentence in five can I understand some words without pausing and turning on the subtitles. But
i've learned a TON of words from those subtitles, and I'm adding cards (using
MPV/MPVacious/VocabSieve to extract images and text). I will probably give up on this, it's hard.

**Books:** I read my first children's book: "Sihirli Aƒüa√ß Evi", Magic Treehouse. This took ages to
get through but even after the first couple pages it started getting easier. That book is paper; on
my phone/eReader I'm using KOReader app to read a collection of children's fables. That is harder
and I fear the language might be a bit old-style. But reading is reading and reading is essential.

I can't tell you how happy I am that, for the first time in my entire life, I actually read a book
in Turkish. A book for tiny kids, but goddamn, I did it! üèÜ

Timewise I am still spending more time on Anki than on media because I want to get my vocab up over
1K as soon as possible.

### September

I moved myself to **Stage 2A** since I reached 1K words on Anki!

**Books:** I read two more books, one for children "Barba ile Rabarba" (which was GREAT!) and one manga, "Tokyo
Revengers 1". I have to do lots of lookups, but I feel like out of all my activities, reading is
getting me the most immersion bang for the buck. I feel like I am understanding so much more now
already than I was two months ago.

**Vocab:** I'm around 1200 words now, and I've gotten through my list of 1000. I also turned the new cards per
day on the 5k list down to 20, now that I've also crossed the 1000 line on that deck as well. Some
words are really not sticking -- they become leeches and auto-suspend. Don't care, don't worry.
These words are all so common that I'll get them from immersion anyway. Just move on.

**Media:** I gave up on Pokemon as expected. But I found [Avatar the Last Airbender](https://www.turkanime.co/anime/avatar) and have been using
Whisper AI to generate accurate subs for each episode as I watch it. This is nice because it forces
me to read every line, and after I edit the sub file I watch the whole episode. I'm only about five
episodes in, but finding that the speech rate is _much_ slower than Pokemon. Especially the scenes
focuing on the Fire
Nation (Ate≈ü Ulusu!) Prince Zuko and his Uncle, are often spoken very zen-like and slow. Without
subtitles I can't understand very much, but it is definitely getting a little easier. I am still
watching YouTube channels as above.

## Verdict

OK so I feel like I'm spending a TON of time in immersion between all of these different mixed up
activities. I've never spent this much time trying to learn Turkish. I think it is starting to
click; each book has been a little bit easier than the last. There is still a long way to go: videos and
anime are still very incomprehensible without subtitles. But even THAT is a bit
better already. The vocab base is really helping, as I'm hearing words now that I didn't know six week ago.
And some of the grammar structures are popping out to my ears a little bit.

Luckily I have matching subs from my Avatar shows, and YouTube has CC on a lot of videos too. I'm
still going to need those for a while.

Onward!
