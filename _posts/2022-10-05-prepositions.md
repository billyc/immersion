There are a zillion rules for figuring out what articles (der/die/das/d..) to use with German prepositions, but I think I've distilled it down into a couple tips that get you there almost all the time! And without giant tables of articles to memorize.

Follow along!

## Step 1: You have to know the noun's gender first or it's all hopeless

Prepositions are called "pre-positions" for a reason: they always precede a noun or pronoun. You will never get the article right if you don't know whether the noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. So, immerse until you get a feel for the gender of your nouns! There are plenty of hints based on either the noun's endings (e.g., "-ung" is feminine, "-chen" is neuter) or the type of word (e.g., months are masculine).

However you figure it out, you need to know your genders first.

## Step 2a: Most of the time, prepositions use the dative case and articles

Prepositions **change the articles of the nouns** that follow them. Why? I have no idea. They just do, there is no "why". This means that when you see "in der Wohnung", the noun "Wohnung" doesn't get its usual "die" article. Wohnung is still a feminine noun! It's just that the preposition "in" deforms the article that follows it. This will make sense if you keep reading so follow along.

The default if you are not sure: **use the dative!** This will be correct probably 3/4 of the time, and that's pretty good already!

Dative is pretty easy:

- `die` becomes `der`
- `der` and `das` both become `dem`
- All plurals use `den` -- _and the noun itself gets an extra `-n` on the end_

Examples:

- Die Geschichte mit <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">der</span> Maus
- Er hat Angst vor <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">den</span> Hunde<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">n</span>
- Es ist gefährlich bei <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">dem</span> Wetter
- Kaum auf <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">dem</span> Markt und schon vergriffen.

## Step 2b: However, some prepositions always take accusative, while others always take the genitive case

There is a very short list of prepositions that always, always, take either accusative or genitive. No exceptions! So these will eventually just "sound right" with enough immersion:

<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">durch, für, ohne, um, gegen</span> always use the accusative articles. And accusative is even easier than dative:

- Masculine `der` becomes `den`
- The rest don't change at all! Feminine and plurals keep `die` and neuter keeps `das`. There's no step 3!

<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">statt, trotz, wegen, während</span> always use genitive -- _but even this is changing and you'll hear natives just using dative for these nowadays_

- Masculine and neuter use `des` -- _and the noun itself gets an extra '-s' on the end_
- Feminine and plurals use `der`
- There are a few others that take this case, but they are not in common usage. You'll hear them eventually.

## Step 3: The only tricky ones: These nine prepositions use the <span style="color: mediumslateblue">Action: Accusative! Dull, Dative</span> rule.

<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">an, auf, in, über, unter, neben, zwischen, hinter, vor</span>

This set of very common spatial prepositions are dative by default, but they use accusative when there is a **change of location** or a **change in state**. Note that motion by itself _without changing your location or state_ doesn't trigger the accusative: so, jumping up and down or running in place don't count.

Think of it as the difference between being **in** a place (dative), versus **going into** a place (accusative).

So if a cat is just sitting on the couch, or sleeping under the table, it's dull dative. If the cat **jumps onto** the couch, it's active accusative!

- Die Katze <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">schläft</span> auf <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">dem</span> Sofa.
- Die Katze <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">springt</span> auf <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">den</span> Tisch!!\*
- Der Mann <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">wartet</span> neben <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">der</span> Tür
- Der Mann <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">läuft</span> bis an <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">die</span> Tür
- Das hässliche Entlein verwandelte sich <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">in einen</span> wunderschönen Schwan. <br/>(The swan changed its state, not its location! Still pretty active, yo!)

<span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">\*Bonus round!</span> If you say, _Die Katze springt auf <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">dem</span> Tisch_ instead of "auf <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">den</span> Tisch", that actually means the cat is jumping up and down on top of the table -- not jumping onto it. That cat is annoying! What is wrong with that cat? Maybe it's trying to catch a fly or something.

## Step 4: Some combos contract!

You'll hear natives contracting a lot of the preposition+article combinations. Many of these are **so common** that you will almost never hear them split apart as separate words!

- <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">im</span> (in dem); <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">ins</span> (in das)
- <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">zum</span> (zu dem); <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">zur</span> (zu der)
- <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">fürs</span> (für das)
- <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">ans</span> (an das); <span style="color: mediumslateblue; font-weight: bold">aufs</span> (auf das)
- And so on. Just pick these up as you hear them, because there are quite a few.

## Recap

That's it! So to recap: (1) Use dative, (2) except for the prepositions that you hear in immersion are always using one of the other cases, (3) and action verbs use accusative!

Oh and learn those noun genders or it's all pointless, lol!

Let me know if this makes more sense than the usual grammar book rules!

Have fun! ..b
